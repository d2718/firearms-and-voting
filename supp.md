Plots of death rate from firearms vs voting results by county in presidential
election years from 2000 to 2016. Point size is relative to county population.
"Average" lines are the population-weighted, aggregate death-rate averages
for all counties that voted in favor of that particular party's presidential
candidate; the smaller lines represent 95% confidence intervals.

Firearm deaths include both legal and illegal use, both accidental and
intentional discharges, including suicide.

It's interesting to note the increasing spread in both voting habits and
death rates. In 2000, the confidence intervals overlap; by 2016 they are
solidly separate. The vertical lines representing $\pm 1$ weighted standard
deviation of $\log_2(\frac{V_R}{V_D})$ are here to help make the increasing
political polarization quantitatively clear.
